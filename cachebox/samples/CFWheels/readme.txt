ColdFusion on Wheels 
==============================================

CFWheels is an open source MVC framework for ColdFusion 
inspired by the Ruby on Rails framework and 
released under the Apache License version 2.0. 

To install this adapter for CacheBox in your CF Wheels 
application, extract the wheels directory into the 
root of your application. This sample was created from 
version 0.9.4 of the CF Wheels framework downloaded 
in September 2009. If you are installing into a newer 
version of Wheels, you should compare these files with a 
file-merge tool like WinMerge to make sure these files 
don't conflict with a newer version of 
the CF Wheels framework files.
