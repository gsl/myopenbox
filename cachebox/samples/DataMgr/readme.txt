================================================

DataMgr is an open source Data Access Layer provided by 
Steve Bryant. This sample is designed to show how to 
integrate CacheBox with another ColdFusion tool. If you 
want to try using this CacheBox version of DataMgr, you 
should change the value of the cfcomponent extends 
attribute to match your database. For example, if you 
use MySQL, DataMgr_CacheBox.cfc should extend DataMgr_MySQL.cfc
(extends="DataMgr_MySQL"). To get the version for your 
database, download the latest from http://datamgr.riaforge.org
