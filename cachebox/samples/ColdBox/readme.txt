ColdBox 
==============================================

ColdBox is an open source MVC framework for ColdFusion, 
released under the Apache License version 2.0. 

To install this CacheBox integration, copy the contents 
of the system directory over the system directory in 
your ColdBox installation. These files were created 
using code from ColdBox version 3.0. They may or may not 
work with later versions of ColdBox and may not support 
all ColdBox cache features. If you are installing into 
a later version of ColdBox, be sure to compare the 
file /system/Controller.cfc for changes. Other files 
should not be affected. This code was tested with the 
sample ColdBox application in the /SimpleBlog directory, 
which also requires the Transfer ORM (http://transfer.riaforge.org).
