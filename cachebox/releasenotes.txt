CacheBox version 0.9.6 BETA 
Release Notes 

- Added password and login form to Management Application 
	-- note that you need to set the password when you install the framework 
- More Samples 
	-- Added SimpleBlog ColdBox sample 
	-- Modified SimpleBlog to be a stand-alone example of CacheBox in a non-framework application 
		-- this is important because it shows application portability with the CacheBoxAgent.cfc 
		-- the stand-alone SimpleBlog can be installed anywhere, it does NOT _require_ a CacheBox installation 
- Added Cluster tab 
	-- trust isn't propagating to all servers quite the way I hoped, 
		so you need to manually check to make sure all your servers 
		have all the other servers in their list 
		- example 
		- servers are a, b and c 
		- server a - lists b, c 
		- server b - lists a, c 
		- server c - lists a, b 
- Added config settings for memory failure warnings 
	-- these set the time to failure before optimization and time to failure 
		before the displayed warning in the management application 
	-- defaults to 1 hour and 2 hours respectively 
	-- it might be nice to have the server send an SMS message 
		when it reaches the warning level, but hasn't been implemented 
- Simplified the eviction policies 
	-- this was the result of also adding an expire() method to the agent 
		to allow content to be flagged as expired without immediately removing it 
		-- flagged content is not returned from fetch operations, but uses resources until the next reap 
		-- using expire() instead of delete() may result in faster page loads for users 
	-- this should make it much easier to write custom eviction policies 
- Optimization method in defaultconfig.cfc is incomplete 
	-- I'm sort of guessing at this point about how best to optimize the cache 
	-- The data is there, but I want better algorithms for applying it 
- Not tested on Railo, so no knowing if the Cluster storage type works 
- Considering support for MS Velocity?
