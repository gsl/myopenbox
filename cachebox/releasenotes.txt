Version 1.1.0 RC2 
- The "Optimize Now" link added in the Management Application's Options tab 
	in the previous version has been expanded to provide a page of selectable 
	recommendations instead of blindly applying any recommendations returned 
	by the config object 
- Evict Policy recommendations are now provided by a separate intelligence.cfc
	which you can customize by placing in the /settings directory (or better yet 
	by placing an intelligence.cfc in the settings directory that extends it). 
	-- If you want more or better recommendations for your cache agents, it may not 
		be necessary to customize the intelligence.cfc as you can do this by adding 
		custom brain objects in the /settings/intelligence directory that extend the 
		abstract.cfc found in that directory 
- Logging and Email alerts are not enabled by default. 
	-- You can enable email alerts by copying the email.cfc to the /settings 
		directory and editing the CFMAIL tag as needed. 
	-- Logging can be enabled by copying log.cfc to the same directory and 
		modifying it as needed, or by placing a log.cfc that extends "cachebox.log" 
		in that directory. 

Version 1.0.0 RC1 

- Added two optimization features in the Management Application 
	-- Options Tab - an "Optimize Now" link at the top sets the eviction policies of 
		all auto, fresh and perf agents based on current recommendations 
		-- agent settings are not permanent and will revert to default if the server is restarted 
	-- Agent Detail page includes a current recommendation if available 
		-- the button sets the form fields, but does not submit the form 
- Added Log Out link at top right of page next to "Help" 
- General style changes in Management Application - tabs are now fixed at top of page 
- testservice.cfc is experimental - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK 
	-- the testservice.cfc is engaged automatically if you have "cbxtestsite" 
		anywhere in your URL when loading the Management Application 
	-- Currently there is a bug that causes it to replace the live service 
		if the test service is instantiated before the default service 
		- you should never see this bug if you don't deliberately load the test service 

Version 0.9.6 BETA 

- Added password and login form to Management Application 
	-- note that you need to set the password when you install the framework 
- More Samples 
	-- Added SimpleBlog ColdBox sample 
	-- Modified SimpleBlog to be a stand-alone example of CacheBox in a non-framework application 
		-- this is important because it shows application portability with the CacheBoxAgent.cfc 
		-- the stand-alone SimpleBlog can be installed anywhere, it does NOT _require_ a CacheBox installation 
- Added Cluster tab 
	-- trust isn't propagating to all servers quite the way I hoped, 
		so you need to manually check to make sure all your servers 
		have all the other servers in their list 
		- example 
		- servers are a, b and c 
		- server a - lists b, c 
		- server b - lists a, c 
		- server c - lists a, b 
- Added config settings for memory failure warnings 
	-- these set the time to failure before optimization and time to failure 
		before the displayed warning in the management application 
	-- defaults to 1 hour and 2 hours respectively 
	-- it might be nice to have the server send an SMS message 
		when it reaches the warning level, but hasn't been implemented 
- Simplified the eviction policies 
	-- this was the result of also adding an expire() method to the agent 
		to allow content to be flagged as expired without immediately removing it 
		-- flagged content is not returned from fetch operations, but uses resources until the next reap 
		-- using expire() instead of delete() may result in faster page loads for users 
	-- this should make it much easier to write custom eviction policies 
- Optimization method in defaultconfig.cfc is incomplete 
	-- I'm sort of guessing at this point about how best to optimize the cache 
	-- The data is there, but I want better algorithms for applying it 
- Not tested on Railo, so no knowing if the Cluster storage type works 
- Considering support for MS Velocity?
